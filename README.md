# Scripts to set up tunneling for VNC or Mac screen sharing

On the host side (which is sharing its screen), run:

`$ ./host`

On the guest side (which is connecting to the shared screen), run:

`$ ./client`

Both parties need to have configured the proxy as
`PROXY=foobar.example.com` in `~/.screen-sharing.config` and need to
have a method of logging in (for example, the password a user with the
same name as the current user, or SSH keys set up).

You can also configure `VNC_SERVER_PORT` on the host side in that same
file, in case VNC is not running at port `5900`.
